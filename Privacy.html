        <p style="font-size: medium;">
            In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information
            about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we
            indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide
            information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Website. We may automatically
            track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our Website. We use this information to do
            internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and
            serve our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may
            include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Website or not), which URL you next go
            to (whether this URL is on our Website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.We
            use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyse our web page
            flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on
            your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available
            through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently
            during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most
            cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are
            always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use
            certain features on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a
            session.
